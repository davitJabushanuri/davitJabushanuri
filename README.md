### Hi, I'm Davit
- Full-stack developer coding mostly in TypeScript and React.
- I'm currently Building Chirp, a Twitter-inspired platform where I'm recreating familiar features with some unique twists.
- I'm currently mastering React and exploring containerization with Docker and CI/CD practices using GitHub.
- I'm eager to learn and share knowledge. Any feedback on Chirp's architecture or suggestions for improving scalability would be greatly appreciated.
- Open to contributing to open-source projects that actively tackle overlooked aspects of web development like accessibility, performance, and security.
